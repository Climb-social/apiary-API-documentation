# Climb.social API

A super-simple public service for getting content out of Climb.social.

Client libraries are available for [Angular.js](https://github.com/Climb-social/angular-climb) and [React.js](https://github.com/Climb-social/react-climb-social)


# Group Collections

Collections are the individual feeds you make within Climb.social. They represent different hashtags, users and social networks all in one place.

## Collection [/collections/{collection_id}{?min_id}{?max_id}{?callback}]

+ Parameters
    + collection_id (string, required) - ID of the Climb.social collection you want to pull in.

    + min_id (string, optional) - ID of the latest item you received from the endpoint.

        Useful for polling: use this parameter to get all subsequently approved items.

    + max_id (string, optional) - ID of the latest item you want to receive.

        Sometimes you may want to collect all approve items up to a point in time.

    + callback (JavaScript function, optional) - Function to call if you want to make a `JSONP` request.


### Approved items in collection [GET]

Returns a list of items which have been moderated and approved within the Climb.social admin.

Each item in the list includes:
- `source_type` describes social network where the item was posted
- If the item includes an image, the URL and size attributes are included in `image`
- The `message` attribute includes the text in the body of the item
- Information about the author is described in the `author` attribute
